# Submit your package to the official website!

If you are the author of a library that can help other users of grammY, you can submit a PR on GitHub that adds a page for it to the official website of grammY.
This will enable other users to find it, and it gives you a simple way to have a good documentation.

Here are a few things that we expect from your package if you want it to be displayed here.

1. It has a README file with instructions how to use it.
2. Your PR adds a page that includes meaningful content about

   - what problem your package solves, and
   - how to use it.

   In the simplest case, you can copy the text from your README file. 3. It is open source software that is published under a permissive license, preferable MIT (like grammY), or ISC.

It would be cool if your package also runs on Deno, and we will move those plugins to the top of the list.
However, Deno support is not a strict requirement.
