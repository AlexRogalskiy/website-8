## What is grammY?

grammY is a piece of software that you can use when you want to program your own chat bot for [the Telegram messenger](https://telegram.org).
When you make bots, you will notice that some parts of this process are tedious and always the same.
grammY does the heavy lifting for you and makes it super simple to create a bot.

## When was grammY created?

The first publish of grammY code was in late March, 2021.
It reached the first stable version a few weeks later.

## How is grammY developed?

grammY is completely free and open source software, developed by a team of volunteers.
Its code is available on GitHub.

## What programming language does grammY use?

grammY is written from the ground up in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.
It can therefore run on Node.js.
However, grammY can also run on Deno, which positions itself as the successor of Node.js.
(Technically, you can actually run grammY in modern browsers, even though this will rarely be useful.)

## How does grammY compare to its competitors?

If you're coming from a different programming language or a different JavaScript framework, you can check out our [detailed comparison](./comparison.md) between frameworks.

## Where can i host a deno app?

Because deno is new and its ecosystem small, the number of places where you can host a deno app are small.
Here's a small list of places you can host your deno app(see <https://t.me/grammyjs/15260>):

1. [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.dev)
1. [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
1. Heroku, [read here](https://dev.to/ms314006/deploy-your-deno-apps-to-heroku-375h)
