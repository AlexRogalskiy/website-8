# Overview

Welcome to grammY!
You have come to the right place.

grammY is a framework for creating Telegram bots.
It can be used from TypeScript and JavaScript and runs on Node.js, Deno, and in the browser.

Check out the [Introduction](./introduction.md) if you are new to writing Telegram bots, and do so especially if you have little coding experience.

If you know how to write an application in Node.js or even already created a Telegram bot with another JavaScript framework before, get up and running in minutes with our [Getting started](./getting-started.md) guide.

There are two main parts of this documentation.
The first one (you're looking at it!) introduces the concepts behind both grammY and bots in general, and helps you understand how grammY makes your life easier.
Check our the Learn section to see what sections are available.
You may also want to read up about our great plugins that help you with building rich menus, storing data, translating your bot to multiple languages, and much more.

The second part is the grammY [API Reference](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/grammy/mod.ts), linked at the top of the page.
This is a detailed overview over every single bit of code and every option that grammY provides to you.
It is automatically generated from the code and contains detailed descriptions about each part of the library.
You can see it as a collection of all the useful explanations that you find in the tooltips when you hover your cursor over any element of grammY.
Some central topics of grammY have brief outlines in the API Reference, too.
