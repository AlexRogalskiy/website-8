Contributions are welcome!

The `logos/` directory only contains the logos of grammY, all website-related things are in `site/`.
The `grammydocsbot/` directory contains the code for [@grammYdocsbot](https://t.me/grammYdocsbot).

## Building the Website Locally

Setup (once): `cd` into `site/` and run `npm install`.
